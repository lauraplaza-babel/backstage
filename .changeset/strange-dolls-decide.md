'@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend': minor
---

Added `github:deployKey:create` and `github:environment:create` scaffolder actions. You will need to add `read/write` permissions to your GITHUB_TOKEN and/or Github Backstage App for Repository `Administration` (for deploy key functionality) and `Environments` (for Environment functionality)
